# Style Transfer with Deep Learning
This Notebook is based on the paper Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys and Programa Nanodegree PyTorch Scholarship Challenge of Udacity. This paper talk about how to use the 19-layer VGG Network to extrack the style from one imagen and the conent for the other, passing the style to the content. The 19-layer VGG is a series of convultion network and pooling with fully connected layers.
